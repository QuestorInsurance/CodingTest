Candidate Coding Test

# Guidelines
Please do not fork this repository
Please clone this repository and push it to your own publically available repository (e.g. Github, Bitbucket) and once you have completed the Task please send a link to it back to your recruitment contact for reviewing.

You can install Visual Studio Community if you do not have a copy of Visual Studio on your computer.

# Scenario
The application you will be building is a quiz. There is a Web API Controller in the solution which will provide you with the questions. The solution uses a hardcoded/mocked repository to avoid using a real data source.
To avoid using two projects the API Controller is contained in the main project but if you wish you can move it to an individual project.

It is expected that you will produce:

Tested maintainable code
Clean code and OOP design
You are free to make any changes you feel necessary but it would be good to keep consistency in mind.

# Tasks
Using the React ASP.Net Core 2 app in the solution consume the REST Web API controller. Display the Questions on a web page along with UI elements for the answers.
If you wish to use a standard ASP.Net Core 2 Web Application MVC project or another front-end framework please transfer the relevant classes to a new ASP.Net Core 2 Web Application MVC project. 

Equally if you wish to use React with Redux please transfer the relevant files to a new React with Redux ASP.Net 2 Core Web Application. 

Include a button to check if the answers are correct. Display a counter with a score showing how many questions the user got correct.
